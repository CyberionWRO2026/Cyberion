⚡️ Electronic Systems

Our robot's electronic architecture is built around a clear separation of responsibilities: a Raspberry Pi 5 handles all vision processing and high-level navigation, while an ESP32 microcontroller manages every time-critical control task — motor drive, steering, and sensor reading — in real time. These two processors communicate over a dedicated UART serial link, keeping vision latency completely isolated from motion control.

Power is distributed across three independent paths: the drive motor is fed directly from the 4S Li-ion battery through a BTS7960 H-bridge driver, the steering servo runs from a dedicated regulated Rail A, and all computing and sensing electronics share a separate regulated Rail B. This three-way separation ensures that motor switching transients and servo current spikes never reach the Raspberry Pi 5, ESP32, or sensors. A full Fritzing wiring diagram documenting every power and signal connection is included in the repository.
